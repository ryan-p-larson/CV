\begin{cvletter}
%\lettersection{About Me}
I'm enthused to write you about your Data Visualization Engineer position advertised on your website. My name is Ryan Larson and I come from an Informatics background, so much of what I studied is an intersection of computation, analytics, and design. And ever since I took an Information Visualization class, visualization has been a driving force in my education at the University of Iowa and beyond. For a deeper look at what I've learned \href{https://ryan-p-larson.github.io/college-sankey/large.html}{here is a visualization} of my college curriculum. I feel strongly that my interdisciplinary skillset is a good fit for your opening and I encourage you to take a look at \href{https://github.com/ryan-p-larson/CV}{my portfolio}.

%\lettersection{Why Google?}
Over time I've come to appreciate how visualization can be used. I've used visualization to create dashboards and make decisions, render infographics and convey messages, display maps, analyze new data, discover fake-news bots on Twitter, and find signal among noise. Throughout college I've completed two internships with ACT and have tried my hand at traditional analytics. During my senior year I started a 'Data team' at the school newspaper because I wanted editorial experience. And recently I co-authored a paper with a professor, where I derived publishable insights via charting.

%\lettersection{Why Me?}
I've highlighted portions of Heinlen's quote above because of how well it captures the Visualization Engineer role. There is more to visualization than the code that produces it, and there's more to Airbnb than its listings. Airbnb has soul to it, you even give back to the community. I keep up with your open-sourced Superset application and Medium postings, because I think what you're doing is interesting. I would relish the opportunity to discuss the position in more detail. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
